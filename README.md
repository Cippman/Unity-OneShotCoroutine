# Unity-OneShotCoroutine
OneShotCoroutine.cs

### Purpose: 
The main purpose of OneShotCoroutine is to present a plug 'n' play solution to run coroutines of inactive gameObjects.

### Contents:
This repository comes with the main script OneShotCoroutine.cs and few examples of in-code usage of this
class and a scene. Full free and open source.

### How To Install:
- Option 1 (readonly) now it supports Unity Package Manager so you can download by copy/paste the git url in 'Package Manager Window + Install From Git'.
As said this is a readonly solution so you cannot access all files this way.
- Option 2 (classic) download this repository as .zip; Extract the files; Drag 'n' drop the extracted folder in your unity project (where you prefer).
- Option 3 (alternative) add this as submodule / separate repo in your project by copy/paste the git url
- Option 4 (vintage) use the old ".unitypackage"
