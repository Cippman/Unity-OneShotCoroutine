# Unity-OneShotCoroutine
OneShotCoroutine.cs

### Purpose: 
Creates a self-detroyable gameObject with a monobehaviour on it that run a coroutine or a delayed action.
This is useful and helpful if you want to realize some transitions via scripting that may
include the self-deactivation of an object: unity doesn't allow to run coroutines on un-active
gameObjects so this is the "best" plug 'n' play solution I've found.

### Description:
This repository comes with the main script OneShotCoroutine.cs two examples of in-code usage of this
class and a scene.

### How To Install:
1) Download this repository as .zip

3) Drag 'n' drop the extracted folder in your unity project (where you prefer).
